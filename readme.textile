h1. BasePlayProject

p. As the description says this is a Play framework module that contains some base functionality. I use it to help keep me DRYer.

b. The software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind

p. This might not be spefically helpful to anyone but me but feel free to look at the code and use it if you want.

p. If you really want to use it (really?) clone it to your @%play.path%/modules@ folder and then add @module.basePlayProject=${play.path}/modules/basePlayProject@ to your @application.conf@ file
